<h1>atciotola.com</h1>
<p>No gradients, no effects, and no performative stuff.  
Just plain HTML, and whatever your brain does with it.</p>

<div class="tabs">
  <div class="tab active" data-target="general-section">GENERAL</div>
  <div class="tab" data-target="notes-section">NOTES</div>
</div>

<!-- GENERAL -->
<section id="general-section" class="section active">
  <h2>This is my website.</h2>
  <p>And It works. It loads instantly, it’s readable, and It doesn’t beg for attention, validation, or engagement.  
    <p>Already better than most things you can find on the internet, right?</p>

  <p>If you came here expecting a polished portfolio, a cinematic introduction, or a perfectly branded version of me, <em>you’re in the wrong fucking place. </em> 
   This page refuses to perform for you, it forces you to engage or leave.</p>

</section>

<!-- SCIENCE / WHY THIS SITE IS BETTER -->
<section id="science-section" class="section">
  <h2>Why this website is scientifically better than yours</h2>
  <p>This isn’t just taste. There’s actual logic here. Let’s pretend we’re serious for a second.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>1. It doesn’t weigh a fucking ton</h3>
  <p>Your average “creative” homepage ships more junk than a low-cost airline. Massive JS bundles, tracking scripts, five webfonts, a slider nobody asked for.</p>
  <p>This kind of site lives in the opposite direction. Text + a bit of CSS + a microscopic sprinkle of JS for the tabs. Remove the GIF and we’re in “this page is lighter than your cat picture” territory.</p>
  <p>Less weight = lower load time = fewer rage quits = higher probability that someone actually reads something before closing the tab. That’s not aesthetics, that’s basic performance engineering.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>2. Cognitive load is not a suggestion</h3>
  <p>Every useless animation, gradient and floating element is a tax on working memory. Hick’s Law 101: more choices and more noise slow down decisions. Here, you get three or four options, clearly labelled, no bullshit.</p>
  <p>The brain doesn’t have to fight carousels, pop-ups, or elements screaming for attention. It can spend its limited processing power on… reading. Revolutionary.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>3. It fits on pretty much anything</h3>
  <p>You don’t need a 400-line media-query graveyard when your layout is mostly text and a few tabs. This page doesn’t care if you’re on a 27” monitor or some half-dead phone with a cracked screen: it stays readable.</p>
  <p>Not compatible with 16×32 Tamagotchi, but we’ll survive.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>4. Everyone can use it (theoretically)</h3>
  <p>No tiny buttons. No hidden menus. No “swipe here, pinch there, guess the pattern”. Just large tappable targets and legible type.</p>
  <p>Screen readers don’t have to navigate a React SPA pretending to be a CV. It’s plain HTML. Assistive tech has been eating this for breakfast since before you were born.</p>
  <p>Is the tone accessible? Not really. The text is Ant-Accessible: physically readable, emotionally selective.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>5. No image obesity, no JS religion</h3>
  <p>This site does not load 4K stock photos of someone holding a latte to say “I care about details”. Images are allowed, but only where they make a point (like a single GIF to tell an ex to kindly disappear).</p>
  <p>No jQuery, no Angular, no “glorious framework” to render three paragraphs. Pure HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of vanilla JS. Shocking concept: using the web as designed.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>6. Free, open, boringly sane</h3>
  <p>Fonts? System stack. If you want to swap in Open Sans or whatever free sans-serif you like, you can. But you don’t need a 300kB font file to say “Hi”.</p>
  <p>Resources: free, open, and minimal. No CDN drama, no license nonsense. Just stuff that works.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>7. No tracking, no metrics circus</h3>
  <p>There is no “Accept all cookies” button here because there are no cookies to accept. No heatmaps, no pixel, no “we value your privacy” pop-up followed by 49 third-party scripts.</p>
  <p>If I want to know you were here, I’ll ask. Out loud. Like a functioning adult.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>8. It even uses some fucking color</h3>
  <p>Text is <code>#454545</code>, not pure black, so your eyes don’t hate you. Links are styled so they don’t look like default 1998 blue, but they’re still obviously clickable.</p>
  <p>No neon gradients, no aesthetic noise. Just enough contrast to work, not enough to scream.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Empirically: fewer bytes, fewer distractions, fewer failure points, more signal.  
     Satirically: this website is better than most because it doesn’t try so hard to impress you that it forgets to respect you.</p>
  <p>If that offends you, you just got outperformed by plain HTML.</p>

  <h3>If this section never updates</h3>
  <p>That means life is interesting enough to live without narrating it here.  
     Which is the most accurate update I can give you.</p>
